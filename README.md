All code featured here I have personally written. Note that none of it will compile due to outside dependencies 
(helper functions, includes, etc).

My personal projects folder does not have comments in the code. All personal projects are works in progress. 
The Vulkan Engine I am building experienced a massive rewrite from 2/9/25-2/16/25. It is currently in a PRIVATE repository on Github, initial commit on May 8, 2024.
